Changelog for MyUSB:
=======================================

	Version 1.1.0:
		* Fixed DCONNI interrupt being enabled accidentally after a USB reset
		* Fixed DDISCI interrupt not being disabled when a device is not connected
		* Added workaround for powerless pullup devices causing false disconnect interrupts
		* Added USB_DeviceEnumerationFailed event for Host mode
		* AVR_HOST_GetDeviceConfigDescriptor routine no longer modifies ConfigSizePtr if a valid buffer
		  pointer is passed
		* Added ALLOCABLE_BYTES to DynAlloc, and added code to make the size of key storage variables
		  dependant on size of memory parameters passed in via the user project's makefile
		* Fixed incorrect device reset routine being called in USBTask
		* Devices which do not connect within the standard 300mS are now supported
		* Removed incorrect ATTR_PURE from Scheduler_SetTaskMode(), which was preventing tasks from being
		  started/stopped, as well as USB_InitTaskPointer(), which was breaking dual device/host USB projects
		* Changed scheduler to use the task name rather than IDs for setting the task mode, eliminating the
		  need to have a task ID list
		* ID transistion interrupt now raises the appropriate device/host disconnect event if device attached
		* Fixed double VBUS change (and VBUS -) event when detatching in device mode
		* Added ability to disable ANSI terminal codes by the defining of DISABLE_TERMINAL_CODES in makefile
		* Removed return from ConfigurePipe and ConfigureEndpoint functions - use Pipe_IsConfigured() and 
		  Endpoint_IsConfigured() after calling the config functions to determine success
