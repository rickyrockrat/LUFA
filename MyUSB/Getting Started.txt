  DONATE:
--------------------------------------------

Please consider donating a small amount to myself, to support my future Open Source projects. You can donate any amount via PayPal on my website, http://www.fourwalledcubicle.com. This is by no means mandatory if you wish to use the library, but it is greatly appreciated.


--------------------------------------------
  GENERAL INFORMATION:
--------------------------------------------

For the latest documentation, check out the project entry on the Four Walled Cubicle site Wiki, at http://wiki.fourwalledcubicle.com.

For code updates, be sure to visit my website, at http://www.fourwalledcubicle. MyUSB developments are frequently discussed on my development blog, at http://blog.fourwalledcubicle.com.


If you have Programmer's Notepad installed (which ships with the latest WinAVR), you can open up the included .pnproj file to view the entire library and demonstration applications easily.


To compile and use this library, you will need the latest version of WinAVR, avaliable from http://winavr.sourceforge.net. The library will compile *only* with AVR-GCC as it makes use of many GCC-only extentions.


A number of library demonstration applications are included, in the Demos/ directory. Some of these are contributed or modified by persons other than myself - check the comments at the top of each demonstration application source file.


--------------------------------------------
  HARDWARE:
--------------------------------------------

Currently the library is designed for the AT90USB1286, AT90USB1287, AT90USB646 and AT90USB647 AVR microcontrollers. I recommend using MyUSB on a USBKEY board, although any board containing a supported AVR will work once the examples are recompiled.

If you are using the USBKEY, I recommend purchasing a set of Tom Deutschman's USBKEY header adaptors (http://www.wizbangdesigns.com/10017_PCB.html) and female-female jumper wires (http://www.wizbangdesigns.com/20003.html) to make the board much easier and more plesant to work with.

  BUILDING:
--------------------------------------------

The latest version of the WinAVR package (or latest AVR-GCC and avr-lib-c) are required for the compilation of this project.

To build each demonstration application individually, run a "make all" from the project's subdirectory in the Demos/ directory. You can also build all demonstration applications at once by executing a "make all" from the Demos/ directory.

A makefile is also present in the MyUSB subfolder, this will remove the compiled binary files when called with "make clean". It will not however build the library - that is reserved for the user-application, so that the application-specific build options can be applied to the build.

A makefile is present in the root of the project folder; this will perform all the above tasks in sequence when called with "make all".

A "make clean" is also accepted by all makefiles, to remove the compiled/output/binary files.
